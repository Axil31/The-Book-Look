# Steps to run the Web Application on your machine:

# Step 1
Download the code(zip folder) and store it locally on your machine.

# Step 2
Extract the zip folder at a location of your choice.

# Step 3
If you do not have Node.js and npm installed on your machine you can download and install it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
To test that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed on your machine you can type 
### `node --version` and `npm --version`
on a terminal or command prompt window.
***Note: npm is included with Node.js***

# Step 4
Open a terminal or a command prompt window and navigate to the folder that you had created in step 2. Now type 
### `npm install` 
and hit enter. This will install some dependencies and could take some time.

# Step 5
After step 4 is completed run the command 
### `npm start` 
In a few minutes the development server will start and you would be able to see the Web Application on  http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
